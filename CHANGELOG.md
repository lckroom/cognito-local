### BREAKING CHANGES

* client ids are now validated and associated with
specific user pools.
* Nit pick of a breaking change, make the user pool
database representation match what AWS reponds with from the API;
keeping consistent with their response format should make it easier for
us to implement APIs later. Sorry for the breakage.

Migration steps:

1. Open any database json files and rename the UserPoolId key to Id
